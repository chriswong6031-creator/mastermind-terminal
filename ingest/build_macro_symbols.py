"""Merge the macro-instrument catalog (indices, yields, FX, futures, crypto majors) into the
Terminal's manifest, and write daily OHLC for the Yahoo-sourced ones.

Run AFTER build_universe.py in the nightly refresh: this pass is purely ADDITIVE — it never
removes an existing manifest row and never rewrites an equity row it did not create. That
matters because build_universe.py owns the 8.7k equity universe and a careless rewrite here is
exactly how the 2026-07-11 manifest 8,740 -> 34 incident happened (see terminal-refresh.sh).

    python ingest/build_macro_symbols.py                     # merge catalog + fetch OHLC
    python ingest/build_macro_symbols.py --no-ohlc           # manifest rows only
    python ingest/build_macro_symbols.py --out /tmp/probe    # write elsewhere (dry run)

Sources
    Yahoo spark   quotes for ^indices, =F futures, =X FX, DX-Y.NYB   (DELAYED — see below)
    Yahoo chart   daily OHLC for that set PLUS the mainland-China indices
    (CN indices and crypto take their live QUOTES from Tencent / Coinbase at REQUEST time via
     the Next app — that leg is untouched. But Tencent serves no daily history, so until the
     2026-08-05 fix the four CN index rows were searchable with no chart behind them: the
     Terminal dead-ended on "No data for this symbol" under a live price. Their history now
     comes off the Yahoo chart endpoint, which carries the same codes. Crypto keeps its own
     OHLC lane in refresh_crypto_ohlc.py.)

Honesty note: everything on the Yahoo leg is delayed, not real-time. Index values, CME futures
and the ICE dollar index all need licensed real-time feeds. The manifest row carries no basis
claim; lib/intradaySources.ts marks these quotes DELAYED_15M at request time.
