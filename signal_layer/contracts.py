"""The data contracts — the centerpiece of the whole system (research doc §7).

Every series, signal, and backtest result the charting container produces is a
versioned JSON artifact in ONE of these two shapes, so the Mastermind Opus brain
and the Macro Dashboard stock-picker consume them with no bespoke parser.

Two schemas (see ``contracts/*.schema.json`` for the formal JSON Schema):
  * ``mastermind.indicator/v1``  — one doc per {indicator, symbol, timeframe}
  * ``backtest_result/v1``       — one doc per {strategy, symbol}

THE GUARDRAIL (research doc §4 P0-4 / D9): the ``series``/``gates``/``bars`` arrays
are FOR THE CHART ONLY and must NEVER be sent to the model. ``model_slice()`` is the
projection that strips them, leaving only ``signals[]`` + ``state{}`` + the honest
read — the small surface Opus reasons over within its token budget. Enforce the
slice at the read boundary; do not rely on convention.

# structure break (confluence_v2.warn_events): the daily close prints below the last
# CONFIRMED radius-3 swing low while armed. That is a TRAILING STOP on price
# structure. It is NOT the MACD-RSI cross-down (``CS``), which has not been emitted
# to the user stream since the GC v2 unification — 0700.HK printed a red
# "GOLDEN ORACLE · SELL" on 2026-07-24 while its own 3D RSI-MACD read bull
# (CS=False every bar 05-21→08-05, macd>sig rising at the fire).

BLOCKED_QUALITY = "regime_blocked"

# ── the washout-override entry class (signal era gc_v2_wo1) ─────────────────────
# ``OVERRIDE_TAKE_QUALITY`` is imported from ``washout_override`` (which owns the notch and
# the gate and must stay pandas-free) and re-exported here, so a consumer reading the
# emission has one place to import every quality string from.
#
# Its OWN quality string, not a keeper verdict, because it is not a keeper verdict: the
# ratified construction (Macro Dashboard research/BLOCKED_ENTRY_RATIFICATION_PACKET_
# 2026-08-10.md §2, prereg §5 @ the 25% notch) takes the `bear_block`-vetoed fire ITSELF,
# so the fire bypasses the keeper's counter-trend reclaim-and-hold leg — which, `bear_block`
# requiring below-200, would otherwise re-refuse nearly every one of them and silently ship
# a much stricter rule than the one three rounds of gates cleared. A consumer that treats
# this like `take` is correct about the entry; a consumer that treats it like a keeper
# verdict is reading a machine that never ran.
#
# It is a REAL scored BUY: it walks `position_hint`, anchors the rail verdict, and fires
# alerts. `blocked` is never set on it, and it is NOT in the client's SOFT_Q set.
#
# ── the reclaim-waiver entry class (signal era gc_v2_wo2) ───────────────────────
# `RECLAIM_OVERRIDE_TAKE_QUALITY` is the SIBLING class, and every sentence above applies to
# it verbatim: real scored BUY, no `blocked` flag, absent from SOFT_Q, walks the position,
# anchors the verdict, alerts. What differs is which refusal was relieved and on whose
# cohort. The washout override takes a fire the REGIME gate vetoed and skips the keeper
# entirely; the reclaim waiver takes a fire the KEEPER blocked, by dropping one of the
# keeper's two counter-trend legs (the 200-reclaim) while the other (the next-bar hold)
# still had to pass. Two waivers, two gauntlets, two forward ledgers — so two strings.
#
# The verdict is produced in `confluence_v2.keeper_quality_map` (on branch logic, never on
# the keeper's collapsed reason string) and arrives here already decided; this module only
# carries it, exactly as it carries `take`/`block`/`pending`.

    ``position_hint`` / ``last_scored_signal`` / ``last_scored_ts`` walk the SCORED lane
    only: markers stamped ``quality='regime_blocked'`` are display artifacts the v2 entry
    logic refused ("never treat as an entry") and must not flip the position — a blocked
    BUY after a SELL leaves the hint flat and the scored verdict SELL. ``last_scored_ts``
    is the signal's availability date (``known_ts``), with a legacy fallback to its chart
    coordinate (``ts``). The scored fields diverge from ``last_signal`` exactly when the
    stream tail is a blocked marker.

    A ``quality='override_take'`` BUY/REBUY is the OPPOSITE case and walks the position
    normally: the live mask entered it (era gc_v2_wo1), so it is a scored entry in every
    sense. The exclusion below is written against ``blocked``/``regime_blocked`` by name
    precisely so a new entry class cannot be swept up in it — an override fire carries
    neither key, and the walk needs no clause of its own to let it through.

    ``last_scored_basis`` mirrors the anchoring signal's ``basis`` so the demotion to flat
    is READABLE (HK-O1 item 1): a SELL here flips ``position_hint`` to flat off a trailing
