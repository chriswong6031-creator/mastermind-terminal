/**
 * Prophet reconstruction disclosure on BOTH surfaces that draw a plan — the chip on the
 * stream card and the dated note in the detail panel — plus the pin, on each, for every
 * plan that was not rebuilt.
 *
 * CONTRACT (macro repo, engine/prophet_bridge.py + scripts/build_prophet.py):
 *   A plan row rebuilt after the 2026-08-09 outage carries
 *     origination_mode: "outage_backfill_<date>"
 *     origination_note: { en, zh, tip_en?, tip_zh?, date_en?, date_zh? }
 *   A live plan carries NEITHER KEY AT ALL. The builder writes both only inside
 *   an `is_reconstructed(plan)` branch, so the absent case is the state of every
 *   plan on the board today.
 *
 * THE ABSENT CASE IS PINNED BY SNAPSHOT, NOT BY A "does not contain" ASSERTION.
 * `__snapshots__/prophetOriginationDisclosure.test.ts.snap` holds the CARD as it stood
 * BEFORE the disclosure shipped; the absent-case tests below therefore fail on any
 * markup drift at all, not merely on a leaked chip.
 * (One deliberate re-pin since: the zh entry's P&L suffix, previously the hardcoded
 * English "vs plan", became 较计划 when that label was routed through prophetStrings —
 * the sole delta from the pre-disclosure render.)
 *
 * The PANEL snapshots could not be taken before the fact — AnalysisPanel was not
 * exported until the disclosure needed it — so they are a drift detector from here on,
 * and the zero-regression claim rests on `cutDisclosure` instead: cut the two
 * disclosure blocks out of the rendered panel and the remainder must equal the
 * untouched panel byte for byte, which no unrelated movement can survive. (The
 * component diff agrees: every line of the pre-existing render path is untouched.)
 *
 * The rendered copy is never asserted against a literal written here — it is asserted
 * to be the row's own string. Wording lives upstream, in one place, on purpose.
