/**
 * finStatements — pure helpers for the deep statement history that the Massive
 * (polygon.io) backfill adds to `<SYM>.fund.json`.
 *
 * Why a lib module rather than logic inside the fin/ pages: vitest only collects
 * `lib/__tests__/**` (see terminal/vitest.config.ts), so anything that needs a test lives
 * here and the pages stay presentational.
 *
 * Two jobs:
 *   1. COVERAGE HONESTY. The vendor's XBRL payload carries statement TOTALS but not
 *      EBITDA / cash / total debt / capex / free cash flow (`statements.<tf>.vendor_gaps`,
 *      written by ingest/massive_financials.py). Those rows are null on backfilled periods.
 *      `vendorGapNotice()` turns that into the plain-word disclosure the Statements tab
 *      shows, so a dash is explained rather than read as "zero" or "we lost the data".
 *   2. REVENUE HISTORY. The Revenue tab had no total-revenue series at all — it showed a
 *      segment empty-state plus sell-side estimates. `revenueHistory()` derives the long
 *      series (with YoY) from the statements block that now goes back to 2009.
 *
 * Everything here degrades on pre-backfill files: the new fields are optional, so a symbol
 * whose fund.json predates this pass simply reports no gaps and a shorter history.
