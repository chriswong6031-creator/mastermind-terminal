/**
 * idbJsonStore.ts — tiny IndexedDB persistence layer for dataCache.ts.
 *
 * PURPOSE
 *   dataCache.ts is memory-only, so every page reload refetches multi-hundred-KB
 *   OHLC JSONs and first paint is network-bound. This module gives dataCache a
 *   transparent write-through / read-back durable layer so a revisit can paint
 *   from disk instantly (see the PERSISTENCE section of dataCache.ts's header).
 *
 * SCHEMA
 *   DB   "mm-data-cache" version 1
 *   store "json", keyPath "url", records { url, data, ts }
 *   index "ts" (non-unique) on the ts field — used for oldest-first eviction.
 *
 * CONTRACT (all callers on the dataCache hot path depend on these)
 *   - EVERY export is individually try/caught and returns a safe fallback; a
 *     broken, blocked, or absent IndexedDB (SSR, private browsing) must be a
 *     silent no-op so dataCache behaviour is byte-identical to memory-only.
 *   - No export ever throws. Reads resolve `null`/`undefined` on any failure;
 *     writes/deletes resolve `void`.
 *   - `isAvailable()` is the single SSR / feature guard: `typeof indexedDB`.
 *   - The open Promise is cached and de-duped; a failed open is remembered as a
 *     hard-off flag so we never spam `indexedDB.open` on a browser that blocks it.
 *
 * TIMEOUT + LATCH (the "blocked/limbo IDB must never gate data" guarantee)
 *   Web reality: `indexedDB.open()` can stall INDEFINITELY with no success, error,
 *   OR blocked event — e.g. a pending deleteDatabase from another tab holding the
 *   DB hostage, a stuck version upgrade, or storage pressure. The event-only
 *   `dbFailed` latch below cannot catch that case (no event ever fires), so a bare
 *   `await idbGet(...)` on the read-back path would hang FOREVER and blank the
 *   terminal — no bars, no manifest, zero network fallback. That violates the
 *   build-spec rule "a broken/blocked IDB must leave behaviour byte-identical to
 *   no-IDB": an indefinite hang is not byte-identical, it is worse.
 *
 *   Therefore the read path is bounded and self-disabling:
 *   - RACE: `idbGet` races its ENTIRE async body (which transitively includes the
 *     `openDB()` it depends on) against a ~250ms timeout (IDB_READ_TIMEOUT_MS). On
 *     timeout it resolves `null` so the caller falls through to the network exactly
 *     as a cache miss. Persistence NEVER gates data delivery.
 *   - LATCH: a timeout OR an open failure/blocked event sets `idbDead = true` for
 *     the lifetime of the tab. Once latched, every read short-circuits to `null`
 *     without touching IDB (no repeated 250ms stalls, no unbounded queue of doomed
 *     opens) and every write/delete/clear/evict becomes a no-op (openDB resolves
 *     `null`). If a slow `open()` eventually DOES settle after the latch flipped,
 *     its onsuccess closes the handle and drops it — nothing is left dangling.
 *
 * This file owns ALL raw IDB plumbing. dataCache.ts contains no IDB request code.
