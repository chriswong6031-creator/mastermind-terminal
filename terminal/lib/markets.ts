// Market taxonomy + the user's market preference — the ONE contract both properties read.
//
// Background: onboarding (macro-side templates/onboard.js) has always written
// `user_metadata.market_focus` — an array of "us" | "cn" | "hk" | "ca" | "global" — and
// OnboardingProvider faithfully pushes the stashed copy into user_metadata on first authed
// mount. Nothing ever READ it. The write path was complete and the read path did not exist,
// so a user who picked "China only" got a US-shaped product anyway. This module is the read
// path, and it is deliberately pure so both the Next.js Terminal and the static macro site
// can agree on what "my markets" means without sharing a runtime.
//
// Two ideas that are easy to conflate and must not be:
//   • FOLLOWED set  — "markets you follow" (`user_metadata.market_focus`, the field the macro
//                     dashboard's settings modal owns). Promotes those markets' surfaces:
//                     search ranking boost, watchlist seed. Zero, one, or many.
//   • ENABLED set   — every market the user can see at all. A market that is not enabled is
//                     not searchable; its symbols behave as though they are not in the
//                     universe. Terminal-only; the macro side has no UI for it.
//
// `home` (a single MarketId, or null) is what FOLLOWED used to be. It survives as a DERIVED
// compatibility field — the macro dashboard still reads and writes `markets.home`, so we keep
// it in sync (first followed country) rather than dropping it from the shared object. Nothing
// in the Terminal UI lets a user choose it any more, and search ranking no longer reads it:
// a user who follows both HK and the US gets BOTH boosted, which is the whole point.
//
// Crypto is a market in the taxonomy (it classifies symbols) but NOT a country: it is not a
// candidate for `home` or for a follow, and it stays enabled by default even for a US-only
// signup, because a US equities trader who also holds BTC should not silently lose BTC.
