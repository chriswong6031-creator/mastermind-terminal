/**
 * recentlyViewed.ts — device-local history of symbols whose charts were actually viewed.
 *
 * A search result is not recorded merely because it was typed or returned. TerminalShell calls
 * pushRecentlyViewed only when the active chart symbol changes, which also covers symbols opened
 * directly from Macro Dashboard. Entries are unique, most-recent first, and capped at 100.
 *
 * This intentionally uses a new key instead of migrating `mm.searchHistory`: carrying the old
 * search-driven list forward would mislabel searched-but-never-viewed symbols as recently viewed.
