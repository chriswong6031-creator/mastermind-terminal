 * category has nothing in it" (reported 2026-07-27 as "only BTC and ETH are in Crypto", with
 * 24 crypto rows sitting in the manifest). A category tab now browses its category.
 *
 * Ordering: market cap descending where the manifest carries one (equities/funds), then
 * manifest order for everything else. Macro rows have no mcap and arrive in catalog order,
 * which macro_catalog.py keeps liquidity-ranked — so crypto lists BTC/ETH/SOL first rather
 * than alphabetically, without this module needing a second ranking rule.
 *
 * `exclude` is the already-rendered RECENT set, so a recent symbol is not listed twice.
