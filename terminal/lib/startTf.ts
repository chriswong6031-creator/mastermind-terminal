// ── Startup timeframe ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The timeframe the Terminal opens on. Ships as 3D; the user can change it in
// Settings → Terminal (the settings panel writes it, TerminalShell reads it at mount).
//
// This lives in its own module rather than in TerminalShell because the settings panel
// renders on EVERY page through AppShell — importing TerminalShell there would
// drag the whole chart bundle onto pages that have no chart.
//
// Persistence matches the rest of the Terminal's local prefs: JSON in localStorage,
// read through the same `load()` idiom (hence JSON.stringify on write).

// Canonical chronological order for every timeframe the Terminal offers. Also the
// sort order for the top-bar favourites tray (TerminalShell.tfSortKey).
// Second band leads the order — it is the finest resolution, and the favourites tray sorts on
// this array's index. US equities only (Massive "Stocks Advanced" entitlement); the picker
// renders them disabled elsewhere, which is why they are canonical but not universally functional.

// The saved value, sanitized. An unknown/absent/corrupt value reads as the 3D default.
// NOTE: this does NOT check whether the timeframe is functional for a given symbol —
// intraday isn't available on every market. That guard is resolveStartTf, applied by
// TerminalShell at mount; the settings UI deliberately offers the full list.

// intraday-capable markets). Two guards, so no saved value can strand a user:
//   • an unknown string → the 3D default;
//   • a timeframe the landing symbol's market can't serve (e.g. 5m on a .TO name) → D.
// `functional` is passed in rather than derived here to keep this module free of the chart
// bundle — TerminalShell owns the one definition of what's functional.
